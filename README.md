Fifty Two Card Pickup (Bogo Sort)
======================
by Daniel Hsu
----------------------
A fun little program to estimate how the number of tries it would take to pick up any number of cards in order. Default is 52, but this is nearly impossible to complete.

Compile with:
    javac FiftyTwo.java

Run with:
    java FiftyTwo NUMCARDS
